`Assalamualaikum.
This new day of this new year feels special in a way I can’t fully explain,
because it begins with us.
When I think about the future,
it’s not a place or a dream I imagine first —
it’s you beside me.`,

`I want us to stay together always,
to grow old hand in hand as hubby and wifeyy,
sharing every joy, every struggle,
and every quiet moment in between.
You are loyal, humble, kind,
and incredibly caring,
and your affection and happiness
mean more to me than anything else.`,

`Sometimes we fight over silly things,
sometimes words hurt more than they should,
but even in those moments,
my heart never chooses distance —
it chooses you.
We fall, we learn, we heal,
and we come back stronger,
proving our love is deeper
than our misunderstandings.`,

`I don’t want a perfect relationship;
I want a real one —
with honesty, effort, patience,
and a love that refuses to give up.
No matter how hard life gets
or how much the world changes,
I want you to be my constant,
my safe place, my forever.
This isn’t just love for today —
this is a lifetime promise.`,

`I work hard every single day,
not just for myself, but for our future.
Every effort I make,
every struggle I face,
every step I take to become better —
it’s all for you.
I don’t love you casually;
I love you with intention,
responsibility, and a future in mind.`,

`One day, I will stand confidently
in front of your mom,
look her in the eyes,
and ask for your hand —
not just with words,
but with proof of my dedication,
my growth, and my loyalty.
I want her to see that her daughter
is loved deeply, respected endlessly,
and protected always.`,

`From the deepest part of my heart,
thank you.
You changed me in ways
I never thought were possible.
You turned a lost soul
into someone who wants to be better.
I promise you this:
I will succeed — not just for myself,
but for us.
You didn’t just change my life;
you gave it direction,
and I’ll spend my lifetime proving
your love was never in vain ❤️`
